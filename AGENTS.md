# AGENTS.md

Open-Inspect is a background coding agent system that spawns sandboxed dev environments to work on
GitHub repositories. Single-tenant design. Stack: Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript), Modal (Python),
Next.js (React), Terraform.

## Architecture

Three tiers connected by WebSockets:

1. **Web Client** (Next.js on Vercel or Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext) — UI with GitHub OAuth,
   session dashboard, real-time streaming
2. **Control Plane** (Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects) — session lifecycle, WebSocket hub,
   GitHub/auth integration. Each session is a Durable Object with SQLite storage. Uses D1 for the
   session index, repo metadata, environments, and encrypted secrets.
3. **Data Plane** (Modal, Python) — sandboxed environments running coding agents. Manages sandbox
   creation, snapshots, and repository/environment image builds.

**Bot integrations** — all Cloudflare Workers using Hono:

- `slack-bot` — Slack messages → coding sessions
- `github-bot` — PR review assignments and @mention commands
- `linear-bot` — Linear agent webhooks → coding sessions

**Data flow**: User prompt → web client → control plane DO (WebSocket) → Modal sandbox → streaming
events back through the same WebSocket chain.

### Package Dependency Graph

```
@open-inspect/shared  ←  control-plane, web, slack-bot, github-bot, linear-bot
```

**Build `@open-inspect/shared` first** whenever you change shared types. Other packages import from
it at build time.

## Testing

All TypeScript packages use **Vitest**; Python uses **pytest** + pytest-asyncio.

### Test file locations

- **control-plane unit**: co-located as `src/**/*.test.ts` — run in Node environment
- **control-plane integration**: separate `test/integration/*.test.ts` — run in workerd via
  `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` with real D1 bindings
- **web, slack-bot, linear-bot**: co-located `src/**/*.test.ts`
- **github-bot**: separate `test/*.test.ts`
- **modal-infra**: `tests/test_*.py`

### Control-plane integration tests

These run inside a real `workerd` runtime with Miniflare, using the `cloudflareTest()` plugin from
`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`. Important:

- Integration tests share one D1 instance — use `cleanD1Tables()` or equivalent cleanup in
  `beforeEach`/`afterEach` to avoid cross-test pollution
- D1 migrations from `terraform/d1/migrations/` are applied automatically via
  `test/integration/apply-migrations.ts`
- Helpers in `test/integration/helpers.ts`: `initSession()`, `queryDO()`, `seedEvents()`

## Coding Conventions

### Durations and timeouts

- **Use seconds for Python, milliseconds for TypeScript.** These match each ecosystem's conventions
  (Modal `timeout=` takes seconds; control-plane uses `_MS` suffixes throughout).
- **Encode the unit in the name.** Python: `timeout_seconds`. TypeScript: `timeoutMs`,
  `INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS`. Never use a bare `timeout`.
- **Define each default value exactly once.** Extract to a named constant and import everywhere.
- **Don't restate literal values in comments.** Write `Defaults to DEFAULT_SANDBOX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`,
  not `Default: 7200`.

### Extending existing patterns

- When threading an existing field through new code paths, evaluate whether the existing design
  (naming, types, units) is correct — don't blindly propagate it. Fix bad names or units in the same
  change rather than spreading the problem.

### Pushing

Push the branch the working tree is on — never assume a target branch name
(not even `main`) from documentation or habit. A different target is used only
when the user names it explicitly.

### Commit messages

Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `test:`. Keep the subject
under 72 characters. Use the PR body for details, not the commit message.

## Key Gotchas

- **Build order**: always build `@open-inspect/shared` before packages that depend on it.
- **PKCS#8 keys**: Cloudflare Workers require PKCS#8 format for GitHub App private keys — convert
  with `openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt`.
- **Durable Object bindings**: new DO bindings require a two-phase Terraform deploy — first with
  `enable_durable_object_bindings = false`, then `true`.
- **No `wrangler.toml`**: control-plane config is generated by Terraform, not checked in.
- **Modal deployment**: from `packages/modal-infra`, run
  `uv run python deploy.py --build-sandbox-image` before `uv run modal deploy deploy.py` (or
  `uv run modal deploy -m src`). Never deploy `src/app.py` directly; it doesn't import function
  modules.
- **Modal image rebuild**: update `CACHE_BUSTER` in `src/images/base.py` to force a rebuild.
- **Web platform choice**: set `web_platform = "cloudflare"` in Terraform variables to deploy the
  web app to Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext instead of Vercel. When using Cloudflare, Vercel
  credentials are not required (dummy defaults are used). `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` must be available at
  build time since Next.js inlines `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars into the client bundle.
- **Repo owners can be nested namespaces**: a `repo_owner` is not always a single segment. GitHub
  owners are (`octocat`), but GitLab subgroups nest (`group/subgroup`), so an owner may contain `/`.
  Only `repo_name` is a single path segment (it's the checkout directory under `/workspace`); the
  owner remains part of the repository identity in clone URLs, API routes, manifests, and storage
  keys. Don't validate or split owners as single segments. Use the shared repository identity
  helpers in TypeScript; where a full `owner/name` string is unavoidable, split on the **last** `/`
  and encode the owner as one API route segment. `repo_config.parse_repositories` accepts `/`-joined
  owners (see `is_safe_repo_owner`).

## CI/CD

Pushing to `main` auto-deploys changed services:

- **Terraform** → control plane + D1 migrations + web app if `web_platform = "cloudflare"`
  (triggers: `terraform/`, `packages/*/`)
- **Vercel** → web app when `web_platform = "vercel"` (triggers: `packages/web/`,
  `packages/shared/`)
- **Vercel Docs** → public documentation is **not** auto-deployed; run the `Deploy Docs` workflow
  manually on `main` (requires the dedicated docs project secrets described in
  `packages/docs/README.md`)
- **Modal** → data plane (triggers: `packages/modal-infra/`, deployed via Terraform apply)

CI runs lint, typecheck, and tests for all TypeScript and Python packages on every push and PR.

## Sandbox environment

Dependencies are NOT installed at session start (boot is clone-only). Reading
and editing code needs nothing. Before the first test/typecheck/build in a
session, install them:

```bash
npm install
npm run build -w @open-inspect/shared
# Python packages only when touching them:
cd packages/modal-infra && uv sync --frozen && cd -
```

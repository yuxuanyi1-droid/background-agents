"""The harness seam: the contract between the sandbox runtime and an agent.

The seam has two halves with one owner each:

- ``HarnessProcessOwner`` is the supervisor half. It stages vendor config and
  owns any long-lived vendor server process (``opencode serve``), including
  its restart budget.
- ``AgentHarness`` is the bridge half. It runs prompts against the vendor and
  yields the runtime-neutral bridge events the control plane understands.

The runtime ``ActivitySupervisor`` owns terminal selection and delivery: a
harness never emits ``execution_complete``. It yields events and returns a
``TurnOutcome`` for the supervisor to settle exactly once.
